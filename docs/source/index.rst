Welcome to SigMF!
=================

**SigMF** is a Python library for working with radio recordings in
``.sigmf`` format according to the `SigMF standard <https://sigmf.org/>`_.
It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API for Python developers.

..
   Note: The toolversion & specversion below are replaced dynamically during build.
   The root __init__.py file is used as the sole source of truth for these values.

This documentation is for version |toolversion| of the library, which is
compatible with version |specversion| of the SigMF specification.

To get started, see `quickstart`.
